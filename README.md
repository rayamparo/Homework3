# Homework3
This was by far the most complicated homework we have done. To be transparent I had A LOT of help from Google, YouTube videos, classmates and my tutor Chad. After all the help and researching I did, I was able to get a grasp of how to make ths work through JS and was able to break it down. There were a few codes that I left untouch in the JS file as it was already there to begin with. I started off with creating arrays for the special, uppercase, lowercase, and number characters that were a requirment for the password. I also created an empty array called finalArr for the all the arrays with the characters to be nested in that the user chose to include for their password. A variable called finalPwd was created as well in order to input what the actual password would come out as. I then established the randomizer in which how the password would be randomly generated below with Math.random * length nested inside a Math.floor.  I established a prompt for the user to input the amount of characters they would like their password to be which must be between 8 and 128 and also used parseInt (I learned from Chad) to change have prompt be read as an Integer to be used later for the for loop. I have also established confirms for the user to accept or deny for the lowercase, uppercase, number and special characters to be included in their password if they would like.
